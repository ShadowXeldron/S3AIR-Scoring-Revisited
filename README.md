## THIS REPOSITORY IS NOT YET READY FOR GENERAL USAGE AND/OR DISTRIBUTION! THIS SHOULD NOT BE EXPECTED TO WORK AND THINGS ALMOST CERTAINLY WILL BREAK!

### This repository is therefore targeted exclusively at advanced users and contributors who are willing to test out the mod and submit detailed issues.

Work-in-progress Sonic 3 AIR mod that adds a ranking system to the game.

### Known Issues

- Deleting saved records occurs automatically, only affects Sonic & Tails and has no confirmation.
- You automatically drown after exiting the results screen if you're underwater
