esnames.lemon - A list of Extra Slot characters based on a now-outdated ID generator. The mod was originally going to include support for Extra Slots Unlimited, but considering both the impending rewrite and the fact that I don't want to be associated with the mainstream Sonic 3 AIR community anymore meant that I've opted to drop support for it.
achievements.lemon - The mod was also going to have Achievements Plus support at some point, but since Achievements Plus isn't being updated (at least not frequently) I deemed it to be unnecessary, especially considering the fact that. None of the achievements were actually implemented however and only showed up on the list.
